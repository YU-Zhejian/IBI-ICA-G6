# Readme @ IBI ICA Group6

Good morning! Welcome to Group 6! Before starting our project, it is important to state our rules:

1. 代码千万行，注释第一行；注释不规范，同事两行泪。(This line appears in every public project of me.)
2. This public projects prefers **MERGEING** than **REBASING**. If you follow that guideline, you’ll be fine. If you don’t, people will hate you, and you’ll be scorned by friends and family. And **NEVER PREFORM FORCE PUSH**. If you accidentally committed something wrong, fix it ASAP and commit again.
3. Pull before you push, or you will be **rejected**.
4. Use **LF** instead of **CRLF** as the line endings. Those who use GNU/Linux will appreciate you if you use LF.
5. Use UTF-8 instead of ANSI as default encoding.
6. If there are temporary files created by the editor, please add them to `.gitignore` to make Git ignore them.
7. Use Markdown instead of Word or RTF when documenting changes.
8. **DO NOT ADD ARCHIVES (e. g. Zip).**
9. **THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU COMMIT.**
10. Write **informative** (but not too long) committing messages.

## Recommended Software

1. Use `Typora` to edit Markdown files.

## Naming Specifications

All folder should start with a `Readme.md` and `FITF.md`. The former explains what this folder does and the latter explains the file this folder contains.

All `python` file should be ended with extension name `py` and under `python 3`.
