# Formative ICA

## The Functions

| No.  | Function                            | **Person in charge** |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1    | GC content calculator               | WU Yuyun             |
| 2    | Complementary DNA strand calculator | YUAN Ruihong         |
| 3    | DNA to mRNA convertor               | CEN Yihui            |
| 4    | mRNA to protein                     | QIU Xingru           |
| 5    | DNA to polypeptides calculator      | YU Zhejian           |

The fifth function will compute the number of polypeptides produced by a user-specified DNA.

## The Agenda

The following is our plan:

Write pseudocodes and real codes assigned to each member. After the codes are generated, they will be executed by all members as a double check. 

When preparing the poster, make use of the pseudocodes and add necessary details to make the explanations more readable.

A meeting will be held to decide the design of the poster.

## Tools and Skills

The tools we need are as follows:

* An active GitHub repository to which we push our commit: https://github.com/YU-Zhejian/IBI-ICA-G6/
* An active Git installation on each collaborator: Git-for-Windows, GitKraken or SmartGit.
* An active Python 3 installation on each collaborator: Anaconda 3.
* A Python IDE  on each collaborator: Spyder, Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
* WeChat for collaborating.
* Adobe Photoshop for editing poster.

The skills we need are as follows:

* How to manipulate string, etc. under Python 3.
* How to use Python IDE.
* How to interactive with Git, locally and remotely.
* How to make posters under Adobe Photoshop.

The functions we need are as follows:
* Regular expressions
* if loops
* for loops
## The Git Workflow

Our Git workflow is modelled after the centralized workflow (Chacon, S. and Straub, B., 2018). Just pull-edit-stage-commit-push to the master branch.

Branching is encouraged offline but not online unless necessary (e. g. Huge disagreement within our team). Those who encountered a merging conflict is responsible to solve this conflict. Fork is not recommended.

## Efforts to Avoid Collisions

1. We have made a detailed specifications on Python and other scripts on indentation, line endings and encodings.
2. We have made sure that everyone's familiar with the workflow by practice.
