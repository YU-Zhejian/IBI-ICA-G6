The tools we need are as follows:

* An active GitHub repository to which we push our commit: https://github.com/YU-Zhejian/IBI-ICA-G6/
* An active Git installation on each collaborator: Git-for-Windows, GitKraken or SmartGit.
* An active Python 3 installation on each collaborator: Anaconda 3.
* A Python IDE  on each collaborator: Spyder, Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
* WeChat for collaborating.
* Adobe Photoshop for editing poster.

The skills we need are as follows:

* How to manipulate string, etc. under Python 3.
* How to use Python IDE.
* How to interactive with Git, locally and remotely.
* How to make posters under Adobe Photoshop.

## The Git Workflow

Our Git workflow is modelled after the centralized workflow (Chacon, S. and Straub, B., 2018). Just pull-edit-stage-commit-push to the master branch.

Branching is encouraged offline but not online unless necessary (e. g. Huge disagreement within our team). Those who encountered a merging conflict is responsible to solve this conflict. Fork is not recommended.

## Efforts to Avoid Collisions

1. We have made a detailed specifications on Python and other scripts on indentation, line endings and encodings.
2. We have made sure that everyone's familiar with the workflow by practice.
